## Project Details
This project aims to design and implement a Hotel Room Reservation System. The system will allow users to view hotel rooms, make reservations, and manage their bookings. The system will also include an administration module for hotel staff to manage room availability, view bookings, and generate reports.

### **Key Features**
- **User Registration and Login:**
  - Users can create accounts with basic information (name, address, contact details).
  - Users can log in using their credentials.
- **Room Management:**
  - The system should display a graphic representation of the hotel floor plan, showing available rooms in green and booked rooms in red.
  - Hotel staff can add new rooms, update room details, and set different prices for different room types.
- **Reservation Process:**
  - Users can search for available rooms based on their check-in and check-out dates.
  - The system should display available rooms, and users can select rooms to make reservations.
  - Users can add multiple rooms to their reservation.
- **Shopping Cart and Checkout:**
  - Users can review their selected rooms in a shopping cart before finalizing the reservation.
  - Users can proceed to checkout, where the system calculates the total cost based on the selected rooms and dates.
  - Users can provide credit card information for payment.
- **Booking Management:**
  - Users can view their past and upcoming bookings.
  - Users can modify or cancel their reservations before the check-in date.
- **Admin Module:**
  - Hotel staff can log in to an admin area with a username and password.
  - Admins can manage room availability, view reservations, and generate reports on room occupancy.
- **Transaction Report:**
  - Users receive a transaction ID and a confirmation email after a successful booking.
