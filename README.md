- Most communication during opening weeks has been through Trello comments.
## Project Scope Statement
This project aims to develop a platform to rent and reserve rooms at a hotel. The platform will include the following features: 
 - User Registration and Login 
 - Room Management
 - Reservation Process
 - Shopping Cart and Checkout
 - Booking Management
 - Admin Module
 - Transaction Report
   
## Problem Identification
The current hotel reservation system is clunky, inefficient, and hard to navigate. This is due to different interfaces for user and admin views, unresponsive and outdated user interfaces, limited searching and filtering functionality for users, and it lacks features like dynamic room availability displays and simple booking management for both employees and users. This project will address these issues. We will implement a simple and efficient room management system, which will allow staff to quickly update room statuses. We also will develop a smooth booking process, which will feature simplified room selection, booking, and checkout. Our system will also feature user-friendly interfaces. These user interfaces (UIs) will ensure that users can easily manage bookings and payments, as well as streamlining the process of filtering and searching for rooms that tailor to their needs (ex. price range, room type, amenities, etc.). 

## Project Objectives
 - User-Friendly Experience
 - Efficient Admin Tools
 - Secure Payment System
 - Real-Time Availability
 - Booking Flexibility
## Next to do:
 - Adopt Agile as a SDLC using Scrum framework.
